# My Raspberry Pi 3 Diary

This is a diary respository to log my experience on learning raspberry pi 3B.

I have no experience on previouse pi versions (2B, 1, 0...) and has a little Linux knowledge base. My target on Pi3 is to build a wireless speaker mock up headlessly. So pixel desktop is not my focus. The main focus on this diary should be:

* RASPBERRY PI 3 MODEL B
* RASPBIAN JESSIE LITE
* Python and C++
* Linux Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and audio programming

## Content

### Setup the Pi

[Get a Pi](docs/get_a_pi.md) <br/>
[Install Linux for Pi](docs/install_linux.md) <br/>
[Working headlessly](docs/working_headless.md) <br/>

### Useful Hints

[Mount ext3 Patition to Windows or OSX] (docs/mount_ext3_patition.md)

## Useful Link

90% informations could be got from Internet, such as

* Raspberry Pi official site: www.raspberrypi.org/ <br/>
* Google: www.google.com and,
* Github: www.github.com (Sadly, in China, it is not easy to get Google access. Thanks our boss to built a VPN in company)

There are thousands guides, discussion threads, and sample codes you can found. But sometimes, searching and reading still take a lot of times. That's why I made this diary to pack and sort those informations and hope it can help some newbies like me.
