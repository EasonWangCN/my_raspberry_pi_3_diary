# My Raspberry Pi 3 Diary
This is a diary respository to log my experience on learning raspberry pi 3B.

I have no experience on previouse pi versions (2B, 1, 0...) and has a little Linux knowledge base. My target on rpi3 is to build a wireless speaker mock up headlessly. The diary will only focus on:

* RASPBERRY PI 3 MODEL B
* RASPBIAN JESSIE LITE
* Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and audio system
* Python and C++ programming
