# My Raspberry Pi 3 Diary

This is a diary respository to log my experience on learning raspberry pi 3B.

I have no experience on previouse pi versions (2B, 1, 0...) and has a little Linux knowledge base. My target on Pi3 is to build a wireless speaker mock up headlessly. So pixel desktop is not my focus. The main focus on this diary should be:

* RASPBERRY PI 3 MODEL B
* RASPBIAN JESSIE LITE
* Python and C++
* Linux Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and audio programming

## Content

[Get a Pi](docs/get_a_pi.md) <br/>
[Install Linux for Pi](docs/install_linux.md) <br/>

## Useful Link

Raspberry Pi official site: www.raspberrypi.org/ <br/>
Google: www.google.com and Github: www.github.com (Sadly, in China, it is not easy to get Google access. Thanks our boss to built a VPN in company)

Then you can solve 90% problems with a lot of information, sample codes from many fortums. But sometimes, searching and reading is also not easy. So that's why I made this diary for memo and hope it will help some newbies like me.
