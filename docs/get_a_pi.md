## Buy a Pi

rpi3 is easy to get from internet.

* China, it could be found in JD: www.jd.com or Taobao: www.taobao.com in about 300RMB.
* American, it is about 39USD in Amazon.

## Accessories
There are a lot of rpi accessories, some are essential and recommend to have:

* A **USB micro B power cable** with switch is recommended. There are no power swith in the board itself. It is quite annoying to plug and unplug USB cable times and times.
* A **16GB class 10 SD card** is also recommended and 8GB is also required. Class 10 provides faster data access.

Something are unnecessary:
* **5V 2.5A  Power adapter** though Pi requires 5V 2.5A power input offically, a iPad adapter in 5V 2.1A is enough. But make sure you have a qualified adapter and USB cables, or you'll face some random SD card RW issue without clues.
* **Fins or funs** is usually not necessary, unless with the case.
* **a LED screen** is a good choice to build an bussiness demo. But Pi can be worked totoally headlessly with SSH. Also, a TV or other PC monitor with HDMI is works.

A lot of other accessories is availabe in JD, Taobao and Amazon base on your requirements:
* **A case** to protect Pi. My Pi used to drop from the table and the SD card reader broken.
* **USB keyboard** It is quite convenience to has a USB keyboard, but also not a must. There are some some special wired or wireless mini keyboard can be used as remote controller. Check them in internet.
* **USB mouse** I believe everyone has it.
* **A Wi-Fi dongle or a BT dongle** for previouse Pi versions. Ignore them if you are using 3B.
* GPIO expansion or LED matrix board
* many other sensors...
