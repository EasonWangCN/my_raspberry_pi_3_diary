## Bbuy a Pi

rpi3 is easy to get from internet.

* China, it could be found in ¾©¶«: www.jd.com or ÌÔ±¦: www.taobao.com in about 300RMB.
* American, it is about 39USD in Amazon.

## Accessories
There are a lot of rpi accessories, some are essential and recommend to have:

* A USB micro B power cable with switch. There are no power swith in the board. It is quite annoying to plug and unplug USB cable times and times.
* A case to protect Pi.
* A class 10 SD card. 16GB is recommended and 8GB is also well. Class 10 is required for fast data access. If you have different task in same time, more SD cards to seperate develop environment is a good idea.

Something are unnecessary:
* Power adapter: though pi requires 5V 2.5A power input offically, I have no issue to use a iPad adapter in 5V 2.1A. But make sure you are using a good adapter, the SD card module need a stable power supplier, or you'll face some strange RW issue.
* Fin or fun: maybe it is useful with case.

A lot of other accessories is availabe in JD, Taobao and Amazon base on your requirements:
* LED screen: I am working with rpi headlessly with SSH. So it is unnecessary to me. You can also temperarily use your TV as a screen with HDMI.
* USB keyboard: It is convenience to has a USB keyboard, but also not a must. There are some some special wired or wireless mini keyboard can be used as remote controller. Check in JD, Taobao or Amazon.
* USB mouse: I believe everyone has it.
* A Wi-Fi dongle or a BT dongle for rpi 2B. Ignore them if you are using 3B.
* GPIO expansion and LED matrix
* other sensors...
