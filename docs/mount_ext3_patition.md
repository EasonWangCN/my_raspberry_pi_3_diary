# Mount ext3 Patition to Windows or OSX

There are 2 patitions in the SD card: 

* a root patition in FAT format, contain the kernal and some intial settings
* another ext3 patition carries the Linux file system

Sometimes we need to access the files in that ext3 patitions such as config network settings before SSH accessable. Windows and OSX have no built in ext3 support. We have to use some tools.
